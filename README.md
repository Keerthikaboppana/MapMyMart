MapMyMart aims to help customers easily navigate through a supermarket to find products more efficiently. It provides an interactive map of the supermarket, allowing users to search for products and view their exact locations on the map. The primary objective is to simplify the shopping experience by providing a visual guide for finding items in the store.

Key Use Case:
A customer enters the supermarket and uses the app to search for products like "milk" or "bread."
The app highlights the location of these items on a store map and may offer basic directions from the store entrance to the product's aisle.
Optionally, users can add items to a shopping cart, view prices, and proceed to a checkout page that shows the total bill.


The app aims to improve the in-store shopping experience by reducing the time spent searching for products and guiding customers to the right location within the store. While the student-level prototype focuses on basic functionalities, it lays the groundwork for more advanced features like real-time tracking, personalized recommendations, and AR-based navigation in the future.
